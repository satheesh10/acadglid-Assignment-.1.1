    <h2>Health & Education</h2>
    <p>We provide robust health and nutrition benefits to the children coming from the most marginalised
        communities.i don't think the worst thing that could happen to me is raising a child with special needs.i thing
        the worst thing is to raise a child who is cruel to those with special needs</p>
    <p>Let us pick up our books and our pens.They are our most powerful weapons.One child,one teacher,one book,and one
        pen can change the world.A child without education,is like a bird without wings.</p>
    <p>Children can't wait for help in the times of crisis. We work to help children move past the trauma of a disaster
        and rebuild their lives.We help children with limited means get access to quality education, with a focus on
        street children and
        girls.</p>

    <p>All children have the right to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life. Donate Money & Support Charity to Keep
        children safe & free from harm. You can also donate online to support a Child Protection Programme.It is also
        the time during which young children acquire lifelong attitudes toward themselves,toward others,and
        toward learning.But it is not the time for formal academic instruction.</p>
    <p>Childhood is not a race to see how quickly a child can read.write, and count.Childhood is a small window of time
        to learn and develop at the pace which is right for each individual child.Early childhood is a very important
        period of life.It is a period when children learn an enormous amount about
        the everyday world.</p>
